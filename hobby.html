        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <p>What can i say? I just realy like the feeling of fulfillment that you get after a session of calisthenics. I have been going to the gym since my teens 
          and got bored of gym exercises, until i got to know calisthenics, since then i couldn't stop.</p>

        <h2>Game</h2>
        <p>My love for games started very early with my first console "NES" at 6 years and still going strong 29 years later. After a played WoW (World of Warcraft) for the first 
          time my focus for games completely shifted for the PC, making my acc on steam, and like most steam users, making a collection of games that you have and wish to have 
          time to play at some point.</p>
        <p>Because of my design profession and personal taste i have a soft spot for games that use pixel art. I also love sim farm games and survival games that i can play with friends.
          I am always open to friendly invites to play in case or tastes match, you can see some of the exemples of games that i love right below:

        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>I’m certainly no masterchef, i am more of a guy that like to do it himself. It probabily started with videos on how to make food to better balance my diet and exercise, from
          there i got to like cooking and started experimenting with lunch, prep meal for the week, etc.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy looking up for cooking utensils, how am i going to use it, where am i going to use it, how to balance and use different kinds of spices, what do they do and soo on.
          Nowadays am in a dessert cooking phase, at one point i had just bought some expensive brownie, tasted it and thougth to myself: "I can probabily do one better and cheaper at home", 
          from then on the rest is history.</p>
